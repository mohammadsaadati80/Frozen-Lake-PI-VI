# Markov Decision Process

Homework #3, Interactive Learning Course, University of Tehran

The purpose of this exercise is to familiarize with **MDP** problems, model them, and solve them. 
In this exercise, we implement and analyze two important algorithms of `Value Iteration` and `Policy Iteration` in different conditions.

We want to solve the **Frozen Lake** problem. 
For this, we use `Policy Iteration` and `Value Iteration` algorithms. 
Using these algorithms, we find and analyze the value of states and the optimal policy to reach the destination in different conditions.
